"""Quality control for the registry itself.

The registry grades providers. Nothing graded the registry. This does, from the
snapshot series on disk, and writes data/quality.json for the dashboard to render.
Coverage is scoped to the providers in data/latest.json. Outcome history is not:
a retired integration keeps its observations, so removing one cannot improve the
registry's own grade (see RETIRED_VERSION_IDENTITY).

Five questions, all answered from data rather than asserted in prose:

  coverage    — for each target, can we even measure it? A provider that exposes
                no version identity is not "passing", it is unmeasured.
  calibration — has the instrument ever fired? A detector that has never fired in
                111 days is either reporting perfect safety or is not connected.
  audit debt  — how many observed builds has a human/agent pair actually reviewed?
  freshness   — how old is the newest observation, and the newest audit?
  density     — what fraction of published cells carry signal rather than a dash?

Usage:
    python -m probes.quality            # print report
    python -m probes.quality --write    # also write data/quality.json

# observed. `instance-sampled` means the value comes from whichever backend instance
